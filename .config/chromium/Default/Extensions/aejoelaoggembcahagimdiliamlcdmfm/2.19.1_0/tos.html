        <h3>17. Governing Law - Arbitration</h3>
        <p>
            This Agreement shall be governed by and construed solely and exclusively in accordance with the laws of the
            State of California, USA to the exclusion of its conflict of law provisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            User agrees that by entering this Agreement, User and RESTLET are each waiving the right to trial by jury or
            to participate in a class action. User and RESTLET agree that each may bring claims against the other only
            in his or its individual capacity and not as plaintiff or class member in any purported class or
            representative proceeding. Any arbitration will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and
            class actions are not permitted.
        </p>
        <p>
            The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for
            Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this section. For
            any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, the AAA, User and RESTLET must
            abide by the following rules: (i) the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions;
            and (ii) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witness unless
            otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. If the claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be
            determined by the AAA rules, and the hearing (if any) must take place in San Francisco, USA. The
            arbitrator’s ruling is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the event this agreement to arbitrate is held unenforceable by a competent court of law, the exclusive
            forum for any dispute related in any way to this Agreement that would otherwise have been arbitrated shall
            lie in the courts, state or federal, of California, and venue shall lie in the courts of San Francisco
            County.

        <h3>18. Miscellaneous</h3>
        <p>
            This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between User and RESTLET relating to their subject matter,
            and cancels and supersedes any prior version of this Agreement. Failure of either party to exercise or
            enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.
            Neither RESTLET nor any User shall be liable for any delay or failure in performance under this Agreement to
            the extent arising out of a cause beyond its control and without its fault or negligence, including, but not
            limited to fires, floods, earthquakes, strikes, unavailability of necessary utilities, blackouts, failure of
            third party suppliers or service providers, acts of God, acts of declared or undeclared war, acts of
            regulatory agencies, or national disasters. The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only
            and have no legal or contractual effect. If any provision of this Agreement is, for any reason, held to be
            invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired and the invalid or
            unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent
            permitted by law. This Agreement does not create any third party beneficiary rights.
